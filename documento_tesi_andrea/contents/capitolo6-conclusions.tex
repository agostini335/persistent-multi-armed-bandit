In this work, we studied the relationship between games with imperfect recall and team games. First, we described how to apply the inflation operation in practice. Computing a completely inflated tree requires only polynomial time, but a completely inflated tree may still have imperfect recall.

Then, we defined personalities as a way to decompose a player with imperfect recall in a set of team members with perfect recall. Specifically, we defined an auxiliary team game
