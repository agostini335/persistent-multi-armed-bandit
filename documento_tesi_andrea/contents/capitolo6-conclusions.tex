\chapter{Conclusions}\label{C6}
conclusions: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item extension of MAB framework to handle pr -> MAB-PR
	\item design of novel algorithms with the aim to exploit partial info
	\item theoretical analysis of the frequentist algorithm 
	\item experimental analysis in synthetics and real world problems.
\end{itemize}


future works: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item tighter theoretical results of the frequentist algorithms.
	\item theoretical analysis of the Bayesian algorithms.
	\item contextual bandit and seasonal bandit with persistent reward, to apply PR in a variety of real world scenarios.
\end{itemize}
