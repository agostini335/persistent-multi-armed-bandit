\section{Research Area and Main Problem}

The present work addresses problems.


\section{Original Contributions}
We start by focusing on s $\textsf{P} = \textsf{NP}$, even on a completely inflated tree.
Then, we introduce the \emph{hybrid column generation} algorithm which computes optimal team-maxmin equilibria with coordination devices~\citep{celli18}. We can use this 


\section{Thesis Structure}

The Thesis is structured in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In Chapter \ref{C6} we draw conclusions. We summarize the main results of our work and we propose some future developments.
